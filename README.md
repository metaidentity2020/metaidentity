MetaIdentity is a technology project aiming at providing the answer to the deficiency of the current Metaverse digital identity solution by developing fully decentralized identities and building a credit system in the Metaverse using blockchain technologies.
MetaIdentity will be available as a layer-3 middleware protocol built on Algorand Blockchain leveraging Algorand smart contracts and NFT.
MetaIdentity works by conducting comprehensive processing and evaluation of information such as credit history, on-chain behavior, address activity level, asset holdings, and address correlation to construct a MetaIdentity Trust Score (MTS) in the format of NFT.
The MetaIdentity Trust Score helps Metaverse users to establish and display reliable on-chain identity & credit records and makes it easier for other use cases such as DeFi, Metaverse gaming and DAO to server their users better.
MetaIdentity will be freely available for everyone in the world to use with open-source code to encourage future improvements.
